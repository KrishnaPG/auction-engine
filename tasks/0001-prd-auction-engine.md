# 0001-PRD-Auction-Engine

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a plug-and-play auction/bidding engine that can be reused across different projects. The engine will support multiple auction types and determine winners using SQL queries directly in the database. The primary users are system integrators and developers who need to integrate auction functionality into their applications.

The engine will work with item identifiers/hashes that reference external item descriptions, making it database-agnostic for SQL systems and focused purely on auction mechanics.

## Goals

1. Provide a reusable, plug-and-play auction engine that supports multiple auction types
2. Enable developers to easily create and manage various auction formats with configurable business rules
3. Ensure high accuracy in winner determination through SQL-based logic
4. Support real-time bidding with low-latency performance
5. Maintain complete auditability with immutable database entries

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to integrate the auction engine into my application so that I can add auction functionality without building it from scratch.

2. As a developer, I want to create different types of auctions (English, Dutch, Sealed-Bid, etc.) so that I can support various business models.

3. As a developer, I want to configure business rules per auction so that each auction can have its own specific requirements.

4. As a developer, I want real-time bidding capabilities so that users can participate in live auctions with minimal delay.

5. As a developer, I want complete audit trails so that all auction activities are traceable and immutable.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Auction Type Support**: The engine must support the following auction types:
   - English Auction (ascending price, highest bidder wins)
   - Dutch Auction (descending price, first bidder wins)
   - Sealed-Bid First-Price Auction (highest sealed bid wins, pays their bid)
   - Reverse Auction (suppliers bid down, lowest bidder wins)
   - Vickrey Auction (highest sealed bid wins, pays second-highest bid)
   - Buy-It-Now Auction (immediate purchase option)

2. **Item Management**: The engine must accept item identifiers/hashes that reference external item descriptions, without storing actual item details.

3. **Bid Management**: The engine must:
   - Accept bids from external systems
   - Validate bids against auction rules
   - Store all bids immutably in the database
   - Support real-time bid processing

4. **Business Rules Engine**: The engine must support configurable business rules including:
   - Minimum bid increments
   - Maximum bids per user
   - Bid retraction time limits
   - Reserve prices
   - Auction duration settings
   - Auto-extension rules for last-minute bidding

5. **Winner Determination**: The engine must determine auction winners using SQL queries that:
   - Evaluate final bids based on auction type rules
   - Handle tie-breaking scenarios
   - Update auction status atomically
   - Maintain referential integrity

6. **Real-time Notifications**: The engine must support real-time notifications for:
   - New highest bids
   - Auction status changes
   - Time remaining alerts
   - Auction completions

7. **Audit Trail**: The engine must maintain immutable records of:
   - All bids placed
   - Auction configuration changes
   - Winner determination logic
   - Timestamp of all activities

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Payment processing - handled by external systems
2. User authentication and authorization - handled by external systems
3. Item catalog management - items referenced by external identifiers only
4. User interface components - engine provides API-only access
5. External notification delivery mechanisms - notification triggers provided

## Technical Considerations

1. **Database Agnostic**: The engine must work with multiple SQL databases (Clickhouse, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) using standardized SQL queries.

2. **Performance Requirements**:
   - Low-latency bid processing for real-time auctions
   - High throughput for concurrent auctions
   - Efficient winner determination queries

3. **Data Immutability**: All database entries must be immutable once created to ensure auditability.

4. **API Design**: The engine should provide clear APIs for:
   - Auction creation and configuration
   - Bid submission and validation
   - Winner determination
   - Audit trail access

5. **Error Handling**: The engine must handle:
   - Concurrent bid scenarios
   - Database connection failures
   - Invalid auction configurations
   - Network timeouts

## Success Metrics

1. **Integration Ease**: Developers can integrate the engine in under 2 hours
2. **Accuracy**: 100% accuracy in winner determination across all auction types
3. **Performance**: Sub-100ms bid processing latency
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for auction operations
5. **Variety**: Support for all specified auction types with configurable business rules
6. **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for stakeholders and external systems to monitor/keep up-to-date on various stages of the auction/bid;
7. **Trace & Debug**: ability to debug issues in production without bringing down the system
8. **Easy to Test**: Engine should be testable with mock scenarios ;for accuracy, regression etc.
 
## Open Questions

1. What specific API format is preferred (REST, GraphQL, or other)?
2. Are there any specific compliance requirements for audit trails?
3. What are the expected peak concurrent auction loads?
4. Are there specific requirements for bid validation beyond business rules?
