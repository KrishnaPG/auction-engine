# Comprehensive Indexing Strategy for Auction Engine Performance

## Overview
This document defines the indexing strategy to ensure high-performance real-time bidding across all 13 auction types, supporting thousands of concurrent users and sub-millisecond query response times.

## Core Indexing Principles

### 1. Query Pattern Analysis
Based on auction engine requirements, the primary query patterns are:

**Auction Queries**:
- Active auctions by type and status
- Auctions by time range (start/end times)
- Auctions by price range
- User's auctions (created/won/bid on)

**Bid Queries**:
- Active bids for an auction (real-time)
- User's bid history
- Winning bids determination
- Bid validation queries

**Real-time Queries**:
- Live auction status updates
- Active WebSocket connections
- Pending notifications
- Rule violation checks

### 2. Index Design Guidelines

#### Primary Key Strategy
- Use UUID for all primary keys for scalability
- Consider sequential IDs for high-insert tables (bids, events)
- Implement table partitioning for time-series data

#### Index Selectivity
- Indexes should filter to < 10% of total rows for optimal performance
- Multi-column indexes ordered by selectivity (most selective first)
- Avoid over-indexing low-cardinality columns

## Detailed Index Strategy by Table

### auctions Table Indexes

```sql
-- Core auction queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_status_type_time
ON auctions (status, auction_type, start_time DESC);

-- Price-based queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_price_range
ON auctions (current_price, reserve_price)
WHERE status = 'active';

-- User auction queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_creator_status
ON auctions (created_by, status, created_at DESC);

-- Time-based queries with status
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_time_status
ON auctions (start_time, end_time, status)
WHERE status IN ('scheduled', 'active');

-- Performance monitoring query
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_performance
ON auctions (auction_type, status, actual_end_time - start_time)
WHERE status = 'completed';
```

### bids Table Indexes

```sql

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_realtime_auction
ON bids (auction_id, status, submitted_at DESC, bid_amount DESC)
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Proxy bidding support
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_proxy_bidding
ON bids (auction_id, max_proxy_amount, bid_amount DESC)
WHERE status = 'active' AND bid_type = 'proxy';

-- User bid history
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_user_history
ON bids (user_id, submitted_at DESC, auction_id);

-- Winner determination queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_winner_determination
ON bids (auction_id, bid_amount DESC, submitted_at DESC)
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Multi-unit auction support
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_multi_unit
ON bids (auction_id, quantity, bid_amount DESC)
WHERE status = 'active' AND quantity > 1;

-- Package bidding support (GIN for JSON)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_package_bidding
ON bids USING GIN (package_items jsonb_path_ops)
WHERE bid_type = 'package';
```

### bid_history Table Indexes

```sql
-- Bid change tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bid_history_chain
ON bid_history (bid_id, occurred_at DESC, event_type);

-- Audit trail queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bid_history_audit
ON bid_history (auction_id, occurred_at DESC, event_type, changed_by);

-- Performance analysis
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bid_history_performance
ON bid_history (auction_id, event_type, occurred_at DESC)
WHERE event_type IN ('created', 'updated', 'outbid');
```

### users Table Indexes

```sql
-- Authentication queries
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_auth
ON users (username, password_hash) STORING (salt);

-- Active user queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_active
ON users (account_status, last_login_at DESC)
WHERE account_status = 'active';

-- Verification status queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_verification
ON users (email_verified, phone_verified, kyc_status);
```

### audit_trail Table Indexes

```sql
-- Table-specific audit queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_table_record
ON audit_trail (table_name, record_id, occurred_at DESC);

-- User activity auditing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_user_activity
ON audit_trail (user_id, occurred_at DESC, category)
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Compliance queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_compliance
ON audit_trail (occurred_at DESC, severity, category)
WHERE severity IN ('high', 'critical');
```

### system_events Table Indexes

```sql
-- Error tracking and debugging
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_errors
ON system_events (severity, source, occurred_at DESC)
WHERE severity IN ('error', 'fatal');

-- Performance monitoring
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_performance
ON system_events (source, duration_ms DESC, occurred_at DESC)
WHERE event_category = 'performance' AND duration_ms IS NOT NULL;

-- Real-time monitoring
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_realtime
ON system_events (event_category, severity, occurred_at DESC)
WHERE occurred_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### real_time_events Table Indexes

```sql
-- Event streaming queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_streaming
ON real_time_events (event_type, sequence_number DESC, generated_at DESC);

-- Auction-specific events
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_auction_stream
ON real_time_events (auction_id, sequence_number DESC, generated_at DESC)
WHERE auction_id IS NOT NULL;

-- User-targeted events
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_user_targeted
ON real_time_events (user_id, sequence_number DESC, generated_at DESC)
WHERE visibility = 'targeted';
```

## Advanced Indexing Techniques

### Partial Indexes for Performance

```sql
-- Active auctions only
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_active_only
ON auctions (auction_type, current_price)
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Recent bid history only
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_recent_only
ON bids (auction_id, submitted_at DESC)
WHERE submitted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- High-severity events only
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_high_severity
ON system_events (source, occurred_at DESC)
WHERE severity IN ('error', 'fatal');
```

### Composite Indexes for Complex Queries

```sql
-- Dashboard query pattern
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auctions_dashboard
ON auctions (status, auction_type, start_time DESC, current_price DESC);

-- User activity summary
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_user_summary
ON bids (user_id, status, auction_id, submitted_at DESC);

-- Real-time auction monitoring
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_live_monitoring
ON bids (auction_id, status, bid_type, submitted_at DESC, bid_amount DESC);
```

### JSON/GIN Indexes for Flexible Data

```sql
-- Auction configuration searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_auction_configs_gin
ON auction_configurations USING GIN (config_value jsonb_path_ops);

-- User preference searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_preferences_gin
ON user_preferences USING GIN (preference_value jsonb_path_ops);

-- Event metadata searches
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_metadata_gin
ON real_time_events USING GIN (event_metadata jsonb_path_ops);
```

## Database-Specific Optimizations

### PostgreSQL Optimizations

```sql
-- Use BRIN indexes for large historical tables
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_brin
ON audit_trail USING BRIN (occurred_at);

-- HypoPG for index planning
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hypopg;

-- pg_stat_statements for query analysis
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

### MySQL Optimizations

```sql
-- Use invisible columns for index-only queries
ALTER TABLE auctions ADD COLUMN idx_status_type
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
  CONCAT(status, '|', auction_type)
) VIRTUAL;

-- Composite indexes with covering
CREATE INDEX idx_auctions_covering ON auctions (status, auction_type, current_price, title);
```

## Index Maintenance Strategy

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

```sql
-- Rebuild fragmented indexes
REINDEX CONCURRENTLY INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bids_realtime_auction;

-- Update table statistics
ANALYZE auctions;
ANALYZE bids;

-- Monitor index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0; -- Unused indexes
```

### Automated Maintenance Schedule

```sql
-- Daily: Update statistics and cleanup
VACUUM ANALYZE auctions, bids, users;

-- Weekly: Rebuild heavily used indexes
REINDEX TABLE CONCURRENTLY bid_history;

-- Monthly: Comprehensive index analysis and optimization
```

## Performance Monitoring Queries

### Query Performance Analysis

```sql
-- Slow queries identification
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 100  -- Queries slower than 100ms
ORDER BY mean_time DESC;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname,
       idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Real-time Performance Metrics

```sql
-- Active auction performance
SELECT auction_type, COUNT(*), AVG(current_price),
       MAX(current_price) - MIN(current_price) as price_spread
FROM auctions
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY auction_type;

-- Bid throughput metrics
SELECT auction_id,
       COUNT(*) as total_bids,
       COUNT(*)/EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(submitted_at) - MIN(submitted_at))) as bids_per_second
FROM bids
WHERE submitted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY auction_id;
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Partitioning Strategy

```sql
-- Time-based partitioning for large tables
CREATE TABLE bids_y2024m10 PARTITION OF bids
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-10-01') TO ('2024-11-01');

-- Auction type partitioning for specialized queries
CREATE TABLE auctions_english PARTITION OF auctions
FOR VALUES IN ('english');
```

### Read Replica Strategy

```sql
-- Primary: Handle writes and real-time queries
-- Replica 1: Complex analytical queries
-- Replica 2: User history and audit queries
-- Replica 3: Notification and batch processing
```

## Index Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics

| Query Type | Target Time | Max Time |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Single auction bid query | < 5ms | < 20ms |
| Winner determination | < 50ms | < 200ms |
| User bid history | < 10ms | < 50ms |
| Active auctions list | < 20ms | < 100ms |
| Real-time event lookup | < 2ms | < 10ms |

### Load Testing Scenarios

- **Peak Load**: 10,000 concurrent users, 100 auctions, 1,000 bids/second
- **Stress Test**: 50,000 concurrent users, 500 auctions, 5,000 bids/second
- **Endurance Test**: 72-hour continuous operation at 50% peak load

## Implementation Guidelines

### Index Creation Order

1. **Phase 1**: Core functional indexes (primary keys, foreign keys)
2. **Phase 2**: Performance-critical indexes (real-time queries)
3. **Phase 3**: Analytical indexes (reporting, monitoring)
4. **Phase 4**: Optimization indexes (query-specific optimizations)

### Rollout Strategy

1. **Development**: Create all indexes in development environment
2. **Testing**: Performance test with realistic data volumes
3. **Staging**: Validate with production-like load patterns
4. **Production**: Rolling index creation during maintenance windows

### Monitoring and Alerting

```sql
-- Index performance alerts
SELECT 'Index ' || indexname || ' on ' || tablename || ' is unused'
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0 AND age(relname) > INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Query performance alerts
SELECT 'Query performance degraded: ' || query
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 1000 AND calls > 10;
```

This comprehensive indexing strategy ensures optimal performance for real-time auction operations while maintaining scalability and providing robust monitoring capabilities across all 13 auction types.
