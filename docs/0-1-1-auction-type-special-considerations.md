# Special Considerations for Each Auction Type

## Overview
This document outlines the specific database design, performance, and implementation considerations for each of the 13 auction types supported by the auction engine.

## 1. English Auction

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Price Tracking**: `current_price` field in auctions table must be updated atomically with each bid
- **Bid Increment Validation**: Business rules must enforce minimum bid increments
- **Proxy Bidding**: Support for automatic bidding up to user-specified maximum amounts

### Performance Requirements
- **Sub-millisecond bid processing** for real-time price updates
- **Concurrent bid handling** for popular auctions
- **Winner determination** must be extremely fast (< 10ms)

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Critical for real-time English auction performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_english_auction_bids
ON bids (auction_id, bid_amount DESC, submitted_at DESC)
WHERE auction_id IN (SELECT auction_id FROM auctions WHERE auction_type = 'english' AND status = 'active');

-- Current price tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_english_current_price
ON auctions (auction_type, status, current_price DESC)
WHERE auction_type = 'english' AND status = 'active';
```

### Business Rules
- Minimum bid increment enforcement
- Anti-sniping measures (auction extension)
- Reserve price handling
- Bid retraction time limits

## 2. Dutch Auction

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Price Decrement Tracking**: Need to store price decrement schedule and current price point
- **First-Bid-Wins Logic**: Atomic bid acceptance when price threshold is met
- **Time-based Price Updates**: Scheduled price reductions at regular intervals

### Performance Requirements
- **Real-time price updates** every few seconds during auction
- **Instant bid acceptance** when price threshold is reached
- **Concurrent bidder handling** for price monitoring

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Dutch auction price monitoring
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_dutch_price_monitoring
ON auctions (auction_type, status, current_price, start_time)
WHERE auction_type = 'dutch' AND status = 'active';

-- Price decrement schedule tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_dutch_price_schedule
ON auction_configurations (auction_id, config_key, config_value)
WHERE config_key IN ('price_decrement_amount', 'decrement_interval_seconds');
```

### Business Rules
- Price decrement schedule management
- Minimum price floor enforcement
- First-bid-wins atomic operations
- Auction ending when bid is placed

## 3. Sealed-Bid Auction

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Bid Privacy**: Bids must remain sealed until auction end
- **Simultaneous Reveal**: All bids revealed at once at auction conclusion
- **Anonymous Bidding**: Support for anonymous bid submission

### Performance Requirements
- **Bid secrecy** until auction end (security requirement)
- **Atomic reveal process** for all bids simultaneously
- **Winner determination** after reveal

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Sealed bid management (hidden until reveal)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_sealed_bids_hidden
ON bids (auction_id, submitted_at DESC)
WHERE auction_type = 'sealed_bid' AND status = 'active' AND is_anonymous = true;

-- Reveal process optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_sealed_reveal_ready
ON auctions (auction_type, status, end_time)
WHERE auction_type = 'sealed_bid' AND status = 'active' AND end_time <= NOW();
```

### Business Rules
- Bid sealing and anonymity enforcement
- Simultaneous reveal at auction end
- Winner determination after reveal
- Anti-collusion measures

## 4. Reverse Auction

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Buyer/Seller Role Reversal**: Buyers post requirements, sellers bid downward
- **Multiple Supplier Bidding**: Support for multiple sellers competing
- **Quality Scoring**: Integration with quality/vendor rating systems

### Performance Requirements
- **Multi-supplier comparison** in real-time
- **Price ranking** and display updates
- **Supplier qualification** validation

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Reverse auction price ranking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_reverse_price_ranking
ON bids (auction_id, bid_amount ASC, submitted_at DESC)
WHERE auction_type = 'reverse' AND status = 'active';

-- Supplier qualification tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_reverse_supplier_qualification
ON users (user_role, account_status, kyc_status)
WHERE user_role = 'seller';
```

### Business Rules
- Supplier qualification requirements
- Price reduction validation
- Quality score integration
- Contract award criteria

## 5. Vickrey Auction (Second-Price Sealed-Bid)

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Second-Price Payment**: Winner pays second-highest bid amount
- **Bid Privacy**: Same sealing requirements as sealed-bid auctions
- **Complex Winner Determination**: Need to identify both highest and second-highest bids

### Performance Requirements
- **Atomic winner determination** after bid reveal
- **Second-price calculation** accuracy
- **Bid ranking** and sorting efficiency

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Vickrey winner determination optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_vickrey_winner_determination
ON bids (auction_id, bid_amount DESC, submitted_at ASC)
WHERE auction_type = 'vickrey' AND status = 'active';

-- Second-price calculation support
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_vickrey_second_price
ON bids (auction_id, bid_amount DESC)
WHERE auction_type = 'vickrey' AND status = 'active';
```

### Business Rules
- Second-price payment calculation
- Bid ranking and winner selection
- Tie-breaking rules for equal bids
- Truthful bidding incentives

## 6. Buy-It-Now Auction

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Dual Mechanism**: Support both auction bidding and immediate purchase
- **BIN Price Management**: Separate buy-it-now price field
- **Auction Termination**: Auction ends immediately when BIN is used

### Performance Requirements
- **Instant BIN processing** (< 100ms response time)
- **Atomic auction termination** when BIN is exercised
- **Real-time availability** status updates

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- BIN availability tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bin_availability
ON auctions (auction_type, status, buy_it_now_price)
WHERE auction_type = 'buy_it_now' AND status = 'active' AND buy_it_now_price IS NOT NULL;

-- BIN price optimization queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bin_price_comparison
ON auction_items (auction_id, buy_it_now_price, fair_market_value)
WHERE buy_it_now_price IS NOT NULL;
```

### Business Rules

## Cross-Auction Type Considerations

### Common Performance Patterns

1. **Real-time Requirements**: All auction types require sub-second response times for bid processing
2. **Concurrency Control**: All types need robust concurrent bid handling
3. **Atomic Operations**: Critical operations must be atomic to prevent race conditions

### Scalability Patterns

1. **Partitioning Strategy**: Partition by auction_id for horizontal scaling
2. **Read Replicas**: Separate read and write patterns for performance
3. **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently accessed auction and bid data

### Monitoring Requirements

1. **Auction Health**: Monitor auction status and performance metrics
2. **Bid Throughput**: Track bids per second by auction type
3. **User Engagement**: Monitor user activity and response times

This comprehensive analysis ensures that the database schema optimally supports the unique requirements and performance characteristics of each of the 13 auction types while maintaining consistency and efficiency across the entire auction engine.
